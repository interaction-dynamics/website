# Manage content with Sanity.io

## Context and Problem Statement

We already had a markdown based content management system in place. However, we wanted to have a more flexible and powerful content management system where users can manage content in a more user-friendly way without recompiling the codebase.

## Considered Options

- [strapi](https://strapi.io/)
- [sanity](https://www.sanity.io/)
- [contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)
- [prismic](https://prismic.io/)
- [nodehive](https://nodehive.com/)

## Decision Outcome

Sanity was chosen because it is a very popular solution.

> Other solutions might be implemented in the future.
