## Coding Rules

To keep the code base of commitlint neat and tidy the following rules apply to every change

- `prettier` is king
- `eslint` is awesome
- Favor micro library over swiss army knives (rimraf, ncp vs. fs-extra)
- Be awesome

> use commands `yarn lint` and `yarn format` to be sure your code
> respect coding rules.

> You can also use `npx prettier --write .` to fix prettier errors

## Commit Rules

To help everyone with understanding the commit history of commitlint the following commit rules are enforced.

- [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.3/)
- present tense
- maximum of 100 characters
- for bugs, includes the github tag of the issue in the description.
- message format of `$type($scope): $message`

These are the authorized types:

- build
- ci
- chore
- docs
- feat
- fix
- perf
- refactor
- revert
- style
- test

> Using the right type is really important since it is used to increase the version number automatically.

## Test

If you add a feature or fix a bug, you need to provide a test verifying your
improvement. You can launch tests using `yarn test`.

## Git hooks

Few git hooks are installed to help you to respect the coding rules. You can find them in the package.json in the property "simple-git-hooks".

Every time you set up a new hook, you should run the command `npx simple-git-hooks`.

## Versioning

This project use [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) to handle versioning
automatically.

## Architecture decisions

This project uses [ADR](https://adr.github.io/) to document architecture decisions. When you take an archiveture decision, you can copy the template `docs/decisions/0000-madr-template.md` to `docs/decisions/<number>-my-decision.md` and fill it with your decision.

**May the force be with you !!**
